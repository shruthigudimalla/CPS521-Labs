Tasks
Exercise-1 
John tracked his lunch bills for the past 5 days. He paid $15.10, $12.05, $20.05, $17.75, and $16.25. What was the average amount John paid per meal? Print the result with 2 decimal places.

Exercise-2
Mark received the following scores in his Graphic Design tests. His final grade is based on the mean of those scores. What will be John's final grade in that course? Print the result with 0 decimal places.
77, 84, 89, 78, 92

Exercise-3
Find the median and standard deviation for the set of numbers given in Exercises 1 and 2.

Exercise-4 
4.1) Plot a histogram for the given below age of population with respect to bin.

Population Age:
22, 55, 62, 45, 18, 21, 22, 16, 34, 42, 42, 4, 2, 102, 42, 95, 85, 55, 110, 14, 50, 120, 70, 65, 55, 111, 115, 80, 75, 65, 54, 44, 43, 42, 48

Bins:
0-10, 10-20, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, 90-100, 100-110

4.2) Change the bin interval to 50 and replot the histogram.

4.3) Which age group has more number of people?

Exercise-5 
Plot a cumulative distributive function (CDF) for the data given in Exercise-4.1

Exercise-6
